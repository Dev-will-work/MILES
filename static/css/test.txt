            When attempting to understand the meaning of words within a message, the AI pays more attention
            to certain surrounding words than others â€” similar to what us humans do! One way in which we can "distract"
            the AI during this process is by diverting its attention either towards to away from other words within the message.
            <br><br>
            For example, take the sentence "The purple fox was a weird colour". When attempting to understand the meaning of the word
            "colour" within the sentence, the AI may direct most of its attention towards the word "purple". However, we might want the
            AI to pay more attention to the word "weird" instead, so that it gains a different understanding of the word "colour", and
            ultimately generates a different response for us.
