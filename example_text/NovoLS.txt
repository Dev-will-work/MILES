The ability to successfully comprehend text plays a vital role in knowledge acquisition for both children and adults alike. However, many texts can become unavailable for readers when there is a discrepancy between the readerâ€™s language proficiency and the lexical complexity of the text they read. Automatic text simplification can be used to counteract this issue, however, many previous approaches put forward require resources that are difficult to craft or predominately available in English, restricting them to simplifications in just one language. As a response, this dissertation presents a mobile-friendly text simplification web service called NovoLS, capable of performing both English and Spanish simplifications, as well as being integrated into other applications using an intuitive API. When evaluated on sentences from English Wikipedia, it was found that NovoLS could on average simplify sentences by 7%, all whilst preserving a similar amount of original meaning to that of corresponding Simple English sentences.
